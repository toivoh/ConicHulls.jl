ConicHulls.jl
=============
This package is an attempt at computing exakt conic hulls of integer vectors. It is so far in an experimental state and everything is subject to change.

Currently, incremental construction of conic hulls starting from a full-dimensional simpicial cone is supported. I hope to add removal of generators at some point, and to improve the speed.
